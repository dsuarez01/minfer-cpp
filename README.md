## Overview

### Overview - Recommended System Config

This project currently supports non-sharded Qwen3 GGUF model files that come bundled with the corresponding GGUF tokenizer data.

Recommended OS version, chip set, C++ version, compiler: `>=` MacOS v15 (Sequoia), `>=` M2 chip series, C++17, clang/clang++. (Note that as of now, the project will not compile with g/g++.) `clang/clang++` are shipped with the XCode Command Line Tools (CLT) by default, which you can check at `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin` or similar, depending on your OS version. Ensure that you have the XCode CLT corresponding to your OS version installed. See [Precision Support](#overview---precision-support) section below for more details.

[Work-in-progress: broader support / more robust error handling in the build config, please excuse any errors and/or bugs]

### Overview - Precision Support

|     CPU + GPU Inference      | FP32 Support | FP16 Support |        BF16 Support        |
|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| M1 Series                    | Y            | Y            | N (CPU), Y (GPU, emulated) |
| M2 Series                    | Y            | Y            | Y (CPU), Y (GPU, emulated) |
| M3 Series                    | Y            | Y            | Y (CPU), Y (GPU, native)   |
| M4 Series                    | Y            | Y            | Y (CPU), Y (GPU, native)   |

For **CPU support**, I would recommend adjusting the `-march` and `-mtune` flags in `function(apply_arch_flags target_name)` (defined at `./CMakeLists.txt`) to match an ARM Neon version, desired dtype support, and target architecture that is compatible with your system. You'll want to set the flags as follows: `-march=<armv8.X-a>+<fp16 for FP16 support, only supported for armv8.X-a where X>=2>+<bf16 for BF16 support, only supported for armv8.X-a where X>=6>`; `-mtune=<apple-mX>` according to your processor version (`X=1, X=2, X=3, X=4, etc. as new M-series chips are added`). Set the `USE_FP16` and `USE_BF16` values accordingly (0 for unset i.e. no support, 1 for set i.e. support).

For **GPU support**, I would recommend keeping Metal 3.2 as the version (see [this link](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102894) for more information about Metal support across M-series chips + OS versions), and adjusting the `-target` flag in `xcrun -sdk macosx metal -std=metal3.2 -target air64-apple-macos26.0 -c ${METAL_SHADER_SOURCE} -o ${METAL_AIR}` as needed (see `./src/CMakeLists.txt`). The relevant section of commands here will precompile the shader source file (`./src/ops/kernels.metal`) into a .metallib library, which is then embedded as a byte array into the program for use by the Metal interface (credit: [zeux/calm](https://github.com/zeux/calm)).

## Benchmark Performance

The benchmark consists of a 512-token prefill and 128-token generation phase (referenced in the table as `tg-128`, refer to the statistics `llama-bench` reports. More info can be found at the [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) project repository). For minfer-cpp, an avg. of 5 runs w/ stderr is reported.

### Performance - CPU Inference Results

This repo currently doesn't support batch decoding for tokens. Thus, the prefill statistics are not competitive with respect to existing inference engine implementations, and are therefore omitted from the results reported here. Tested with 4k max context, seed 30 on 2023 M2 Pro Macbook Pro (6 performance cores, 4 efficiency in the ["binned model"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2)).

\* llama.cpp does not support BF16 CPU-only inference for M2 Pro / the associated ISA.

\** llama.cpp does not report memory bandwidth

Refer to [Unsloth AI](https://huggingface.co/unsloth) or other reputable model providers for access to the recommended GGUF model sizes and precisions listed above, and ensure that you've converted the models before testing. I've yet to find FP16 versions of the 0.6B and 1.7B models, but will test them if and when they become available. Due to cache layer sizing (see the stats for the [M2 Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2), for example), I found that these were the only models that could be reliably tested (without cache misses, thrashing, etc.).

\* BF16 inference using the Metal backend seems to be buggy for my particular build config. There are several related issues on the llama.cpp repo.

\** llama.cpp does not report memory bandwidth

From the reported memory bandwidth for each model, we can clearly see that inference is memory-bound: with the larger models, we saturate anywhere between 150-170 GB/s (roughly 75%-85% utilization of the M2 Pro's 200 GB/s peak, which is roughly what we expect due to memory controller overhead, compute stalls, etc. that prevent us from reaching full (100%) saturation).

Refer to [Unsloth AI](https://huggingface.co/unsloth) or other reputable model providers for access to the recommended GGUF model sizes and precisions listed above, and ensure that you've converted the models (refer to the [Python script README](./python/README.md#gguf-tokenizer-data-conversion-tool-gpt2_convertpy)) before testing. I would test larger models, but am limited by the RAM available on my GPU: the [recommended max working set size](https://stencel.io/posts/apple-silicon-limitations-with-usage-on-local-llm%20.html) — which functions more as a hard limit on mem. usage, as noted in the article — is 75% of the available physical RAM, so ~12 GB for 16 GB system, ~24GB for a 32 GB system, etc.

## Additional Remarks:

### Remarks - CPU Inference:
Inference is not necessarily memory-bound with smaller models. Calculating the ideal throughput based on the mem bandwidth (200 GB/s) on my M2 Pro chip shows that max throughput is ~80 tok/s for `Qwen3-0.6B-FP32` with 4k max context. We only achieve ~38-46 tok/s in practice on the CPU, so it is clear that we are compute bound. 

Most of the speed gain here comes from (1) taking advantage of SIMD on FP32, FP16, BF16 (ARM Neon has intrinsics that support SIMD on all of these datatypes, depending on the processor and version of ARM you compile with: see function `apply_arch_flags` in `./CMakeLists.txt` and adjust the flags as necessary), and (2) utilizing ILP by sending out N independent FMAs per CPU cycle. where N is the number of vector pipelines in the processor that can run simultaneously (in my case, N=4 for the M2 Pro). See more about this at [https://github.com/philipturner/metal-benchmarks]. I am not entirely sure what makes llama.cpp faster as compared to my current implementation, but it appears that they've recently pushed for faster CPU inference, necessitating CPU matmul kernels in hand-written in assembly (no need to fight the compiler!). It should be easier to match their performance using the GPU.

Other processors will see faster CPU-only inference performance, due to ISA support for wider SIMD registers (e.g. AVX2 w/ 512-bit). Other alternatives to better utilize processor performance include [AMX](https://zhen8838.github.io/2024/04/23/mac-amx_en) and the Accelerate framework offering built-in GEMV and GEMM operations... But the former is horribly undocumented, while the latter seems to defeat the purpose of an educational implementation. (It would be worth revisiting AMX, and I've considered doing so.)

Another tool I found to be useful in profiling CPU activity is [Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruments_(software)), a tool (bundled with XCode 3.0+) that allows you to run compiled binaries as shown below:

<img width="1370" height="792" alt="profiling" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1141acbe-dff1-41cd-b413-88936af423dd" />

### Remarks - GPU Inference:
I found implementing GPU support to be a much simpler process. The GPU is better able to take advantage of various parallelization opportunities available in the workload due to the capability of each core to spawn hundreds of threads. For a 16-core GPU (such as [mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2)), this translates into thousands of threads, where each metal kernel in `./src/ops/kernels.metal` — as well as the dispatch pattern in `./src/models/qwen3/module.cpp`, refer to each layer's `metal_forward` method — together demonstrate how the threads are allocated across tasks, as well as the type of work they are assigned. 

In particular, the matmul (see `linear_proj`) is computed via SIMD threadgroups of 32 threads (on my hardware, usually the same for M-series chips) assigned to `matmul_row`, which performs a coalesced access of the weights, loads into 4-element vectors, and accumulates to the thread-specific result via a dot product. Subsequently, a warp-level reduction (`simd_sum`) sums the individual thread accumulations to compute the final result. (What Metal refers to as SIMD threadgroups, NVIDIA refers to as warps.) The matmul is the [primary source of the speed-up](#performance---gpu-inference-results) in this implementation, but feel free to refer to the other kernels as well.

Instruments offers a profiling tool called [Metal System Trace](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/reducing-the-memory-footprint-of-metal-apps), which I will eventually use to profile for any potential speed-ups (e.g. fusing kernels, etc.). The [neural network hardware / the 16-core neural engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2) available on my processor should allow for additional speedup, though similarly to AMX, documentation is sorely lacking.

At some point, I will consider how to implement support for other ISAs, CUDA, compilers, etc. But the ultimate goal here was to first have a functional implementation of single-decode, single-prompt CPU + single-GPU inference on my own laptop, a goal which is mostly completed as of now.
